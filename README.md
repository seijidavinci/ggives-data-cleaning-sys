*Web Application for Merchant Tagging*

*Overview:*
This Streamlit web application is designed to help you efficiently clean and categorize your merchant data by uploading three required CSV files: raw_data, merchant_brand_tags, and industry_keywords. The application will organize and maintain an up-to-date masterlist of Gives merchants, enhancing data accuracy and supporting informed decision-making.

*Project Goal:*
The primary goal of this project is to create an organized and accurate masterlist of Gives merchants, categorized by channel, industry, and brand. This organized data will enable easier access, improve data analysis accuracy, and support strategic planning by providing key insights into merchant performance. While 100% accuracy may not be achievable within the project's 11-week timeline, significant progress is expected in automating and streamlining data management.

#Problem Statement:#
The application addresses the issue of maintaining a disorganized and outdated merchant list with inconsistent brand and industry tagging. This problem complicates the analysis of merchant data and hinders data-driven decision-making, leading to inefficiencies in strategic planning and execution.

*Rules and Requirements:*
1. *File Upload Requirements:* 
   - Only accept CSV files due to their lightweight nature, ensuring easier processing and management.
   - Files must strictly adhere to the format requirements below to avoid errors in processing.

2. *Merchant Masterlist Requirements:*
   - The raw_data CSV must retain its original column headers exactly as provided in the first row. This ensures consistency and data accuracy.

3. *Brand Tagging Keywords Requirements:*
   - The merchant_brand_tags CSV should preserve all original column headers, formatted in uppercase (CAPSLOCK) to maintain uniformity.

4. *Industry Keywords Requirements:*
   - The industry_keywords CSV must keep all column headers unchanged from their original format. Keywords should be listed and separated by commas, with no periods, spaces, or extra characters at the end to ensure clarity in categorization.

*Important Reminder:*
Adherence to these rules is crucial because the applicationâ€™s code is specifically designed to operate based on these formats. Any deviations, such as changes in file type, header names, or keyword formatting, can cause errors and malfunction. By following these guidelines, you ensure the tool performs correctly, maintaining data integrity and operational efficiency.
